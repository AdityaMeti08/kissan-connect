# Final Year Project: Kissan-Connect

## Repository Structure
As of now, the **Main Branch** contains three components:
1) Kissan-Connect
2) Kissan-Connect (Duplicate Entry)
3) Mobile App

The **Master Branch** contains only one component:
1) Kissan-Connect

Currently, the **Kissan-Connect** component in the **Master Branch** is the most detailed and complete version of this project available on GitHub.

## Project Overview
### Aim
In 2020, the Government of India enacted three significant laws:
1) **The Farmersâ€™ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020**
2) **The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020**
3) **The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020**

These laws collectively aimed to achieve two objectives:
1) Facilitate direct sales between farmers and companies.
2) Empower farmers by providing access to loans from approved sources, such as banks, rather than relying on middlemen.

**Kissan-Connect** was conceived with the goal of empowering farmers by increasing transparency in profit calculations. This would enable farmers to understand the factors influencing crop prices and the final amount they receive.

## Challenges Encountered
1) Despite India's high literacy rate, a significant portion of the population lacks technological literacy, particularly in blockchain technology.
2) Payment transactions needed to be conducted in Indian Rupees.
3) Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) needed to be minted with minimal gas fees.

## Project Decisions
To address these challenges, we decided on the following implementations:
1) **Avoiding the use of cryptocurrency wallets** to ensure ease of access for farmers.
2) **Integrating UPI (Unified Payments Interface)** to facilitate seamless transactions in Indian Rupees.
3) **Using the Solana network** to enable efficient and cost-effective NFT minting.

This document serves as an explanation and documentation for the Kissan-Connect project.
