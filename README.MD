This is our final year project for Amrita. As of now, the Main Branch contains three parts:
1) Kissan-Connect
2) Kissan-Connect
3) Mobileapp

The Master Branch contains only one part:
1) Kissan-Connect

Currently, the Kissan-Connect component in the Master Branch contains the most detailed and complete version of this project available on GITHUB.

This serves as an explanation of this project and its documentation.

1) The Aim
In 2020, the Government of India enacted three significant laws:
1) The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020
2) The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020
3) The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020

These laws collectively aimed to achieve two objectives:
1) To facilitate direct sales between farmers and companies
2) To empower farmers by providing access to loans from approved sources, such as banks, rather than middlemen.

Kissan-Connect was conceived with the intention of empowering farmers by providing them with transparency into the calculation of their profits. Farmers would gain insights into the factors that influence crop prices and the final amount they receive.


The challenges we encountered were:
1) Despite India’s high literacy rate, approximately 3% of the population remains below the poverty line. However, this does not necessarily equate to technological literacy, and a significant portion of the population lacks experience with blockchain technology.
2) Payment transactions would need to be conducted in Indian rupees.
3) Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) would need to be minted but with a lower gas cost.


This equated to 3 things that we decided was not acceptable for the project

1)he Use of wallets.
2)UPI would be integrated.
3)We would use the solana network.
