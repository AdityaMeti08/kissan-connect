As of right now,kissan-connect in the masters branch contains the most detailed and complete version of this Project.

This serves as an explanation of this project and also its documentation.

1)The Aim
In 2020,The Government of India Passed The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020.These Laws In its entirety did 2 things.

1)Make Farmers go directly to Companies to sell their Produce.
2)Make Farmers take loans from Approved Sites such as banks and not from Middle-men.

Kissan-Connect was born out of a desire to see farmers to how their profits are actually calculated.Farmers would be able to see how their crop prices are calculated and see the amount they would be able to get in the end.

The Challenges we faced.

1)As of Right Now,India Is Fully literate,With only 3% of indians,Below the poverty line.However this does not equate to Technological literacy,And this also Means that a amajority if not none would have no experience with the Blockchain.

2)The same point as above but that payments would have to be done in rupees.

3)Nft's would have to minted
